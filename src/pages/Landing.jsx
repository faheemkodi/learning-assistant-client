                Can I really crack any exam in 90 days?

                90 days is a pretty long period of time. Amazing feats can be
                achieved in 90 days, so much so that we would dare say -{" "}
                <span className="fw-bold">
                  yes, you can crack any exam in 90 days
                </span>
                .
              </p>
              <p>
                But, as you might have expected, there are a couple of caveats:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>Your cooperation</b>: Learning is an activity that requires
                  energy, effort and time. Sure, it is one of our primary goals
                  to train you to do more in less, but the importance of
                  behavior change, habit-building and the learning mechanisms of
                  the brain cannot be ignored. Therefore, we request your total
                  cooperation and faith in following our instructions to the
                  letter, even if you cannot make sense of them at the time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Competitive exams</b>: When it comes to exams of a highly
                  competitive nature, there may be candidates who have been
                  putting in enormous efforts for years. This should not be
                  discouraging and while it is totally possible to crack even
                  these kind of exams in 90 days, it is only realistic that
                  there are chances you may fall slightly short. Due to the
                  limited nature of these exams and the number of candidates
                  appearing, these exams may simply require more than 90 days of
                  preparation. Persistence is key and you may have to try again,
                  but be assured that during your next attempt, your competitors
                  would be facing a true learning ninja who has mastered the art
                  and science of learning effectively!
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Having said that, we repeat -{" "}

              Hey! I'm Faheem Kodi. ðŸ‘‹
              <br />
              I'm a software engineer from Kerala, India. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
            </p>
          </Col>
        </Row>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Throughout high school and college, I had lofty goals. And I
          constantly made plans, strategies and blueprints to realize them.
          Funny thing is, I was never able to adhere to even one of those, and
          my performance was, at best, average.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came to realize that there was something fundamentally wrong with
          the way I was going about things. To sum up:
        </p>
        <ul className="px-5">
          <li>
            I refused to turn a page until I understood everything in it. Traded
            progress for perfection, achieving neither.
          </li>
          <li>
            I made plans that were incredibly hard to carry through - like
            learning too much of complex subjects like science and math in too
            little time.
          </li>
          <li>I was a serial procrastinator.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of the above amplified the others' effect, and the results were
          disastrous. Let's just say that I was unable to make the most out of
          my formal education.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what intrigued me was the fact that even though the average person
          spends a quarter of their life in school and college, there was no
          emphasis or definitive guidance on{" "}
          <span className="fst-italic">how to learn</span> at institutions!
        </p>

        <p className="">
          In 2020, Kengram Edtech was formed, with a three-fold mission:
        </p>
        <ul className="px-5">
          <li>Spread awareness on the importance of learning</li>
          <li>Help students learn more efficiently</li>
          <li>Make learning more enjoyable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Building upon the latest solid research from the learning sciences,
          and after consulting with expert educators, we created{" "}
          <span className="fst-italic">Mastery Learning</span>, a 3-day workshop
          to help learners improve their ability. Over the course of piloting
          the workshop for a few months, we made one crucial discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, it has evolved into a program I wish was available for me
          during my prime student years. It would have saved me a lot of
          frustration and failures. For you, it sure will!
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward to working closely with each one of you, to ensure
          that all your academic ambitions are realized.
        </p>
        <p>Happy learning! ðŸ’œ</p>
